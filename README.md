# BrainTumorClassification
VGG16 97% Train acc,  98% Val acc and 100% on TestSet 

# Description
The Size of the dataset was 3000, It's a very small dataset that i got from kaggle.
Training Size: 2600
Val_size: 450
Test_size: 150

Trained for 50 Epochs but got the best val_loss at 14th epoch with 98% val Accuracy.
used checkpoints to get the best model.

Problems that i faced:
Image size was not equal for all. >> resized and croped for better result.

#  End-to-End project:
1. Preprocessing  -- done
2. Model training -- done
3. Front-end      --
