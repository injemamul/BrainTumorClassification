# BrainTumorClassification
VGG16 97% Train acc,  98% Val acc and 100% on TestSet 

# Description
The Size of the dataset was 3000, It's a very small dataset that i got from kaggle.<br />
Training Size: 2600 <br />
Val_size: 450 <br />
Test_size: 150 <br />

Trained for 50 Epochs but got the best val_loss at 14th epoch with 98% val Accuracy. <br />
used checkpoints to get the best model. <br />

Problems that i faced: <br />
Image size was not equal for all. >> resized and croped for better result. <br />
